## Adapter description and scope

Financing is the process in which an applicant, member or a non-member of the DAO, submits a proposal asking for funds in whole U.S. Dollar amounts. If the proposal passes, the funds are released to the applicant in Ether to the nearest Wei value. The conversion rate from U.S. Dollars to ETH or another ERC20 token is based on the latest price received from the oracles provided by Chainlink.

The main goal is to allow individuals and/or organizations to request funds in a U.S. Dollar amount and receive funding for their projects in an ERC20 token based at a trusted exchange rate from an oracle provided by Chainlink. Similar to the standard Financing Adapter the members of the DAO have the power to vote and decide which projects should be funded.

## Adapter workflow

In order to request funds from the DAO, the applicant must submit a proposal in which one must specify the desired amount in U.S. Dollars and the token address to receive the funds.

The applicant address cannot be a reserved address, which means the address is already reserved for the DAO internal usage. Also, the token address must be allowed/supported by the DAO Bank. If these two conditions are not met, the funding proposal is not created.

## Adapter configuration

Tokens that are provided by the member have to be allowed/supported by the DAO.

The member needs to have enough units and/or loot in order to convert it to funds.

DAORegistry Access Flags: `SUBMIT_PROPOSAL`.

Bank Extension Access Flags: `ADD_TO_BALANCE`, `SUB_FROM_BALANCE`.

## Adapter state

- `proposals`: all financing proposals handled by each DAO.
- `ProposalDetails`:
  - `applicant`: the proposal applicant address, cannot be a reserved address.
  - `amount`: the amount requested for funding.
  - `token`: the token address in which the funding is made to the applicant, needs to be allowed/supported by the DAO Bank.

## Dependencies and interactions (internal / external)

- BankExtension

  - checks if the provided token is allowed/supported by the Bank.
  - subtracts from Guild balance the requested amount based on the provided token.
  - adds to the applicant account the subtracted amount based on the provided token.

- DaoRegistry

  - gets Bank extension address.
  - checks if member address is not reserved.
  - submits/sponsors/processes the financing proposal.
  - gets Voting adapter address.

- Voting

  - gets address that sent the sponsorProposal transaction.
  - starts new voting for the financing proposal.
  - checks the voting results.
