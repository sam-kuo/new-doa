## DaoFactory description and scope

The DaoFactory uses the CloneFactory to let you create a cost effective DaoRegistry and initialize and configure it properly.
It also serves as a registry of created DAOs to help others find a DAO by name.

## DaoFactory state

The state consists of two mappings to get the sha3(name) of a DAO given an address and the address given the sha3(name).

**mapping(address => bytes32) public daos**
**mapping(bytes32 => address) public addresses**

We also have the address of the identityDao **address public identityAddress** that is being used to clone the DAO.

## Functions description and assumptions / checks

### function createDao

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Creates and initializes a new DaoRegistry with the DAO creator and the transaction sender.
     * @notice Enters the new DaoRegistry in the DaoFactory state.
     * @dev The daoName must not already have been taken.
     * @param daoName The name of the DAO which, after being hashed, is used to access the address.
     * @param creator The DAO's creator, who will be an initial member.
     */
    function createDao(string calldata daoName, address creator) external
```

### function getDaoAddress

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Returns the DAO address based on its name.
     * @return The address of a DAO, given its name.
     * @param daoName Name of the DAO to be searched.
     */
    function getDaoAddress(string calldata daoName)
        public
        view
        returns (address)
```

### function addAdapters

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Adds adapters and sets their ACL for DaoRegistry functions.
     * @dev A new DAO is instantiated with only the Core Modules enabled, to reduce the call cost. This call must be made to add adapters.
     * @dev The message sender must be an active member of the DAO.
     * @dev The DAO must be in `CREATION` state.
     * @param dao DaoRegistry to have adapters added to.
     * @param adapters Adapter structs to be added to the DAO.
     */
    function addAdapters(DaoRegistry dao, Adapter[] calldata adapters)
        external
```

### function configureExtension

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Configures extension to set the ACL for each adapter that needs to access the extension.
     * @dev The message sender must be an active member of the DAO.
     * @dev The DAO must be in `CREATION` state.
     * @param dao DaoRegistry for which the extension is being configured.
     * @param extension The address of the extension to be configured.
     * @param adapters Adapter structs for which the ACL is being set for the extension.
     */
    function configureExtension(
        DaoRegistry dao,
        address extension,
        Adapter[] calldata adapters
    ) external
```

### function updateAdapter

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Removes an adapter with a given ID from a DAO, and adds a new one of the same ID.
     * @dev The message sender must be an active member of the DAO.
     * @dev The DAO must be in `CREATION` state.
     * @param dao DAO to be updated.
     * @param adapter Adapter that will be replacing the currently-existing adapter of the same ID.
     */
    function updateAdapter(DaoRegistry dao, Adapter calldata adapter) external
```

## Events

### event DAOCreated

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Event emitted when a new DAO has been created.
     * @param _address The DAO address.
     * @param _name The DAO name.
     */
    event DAOCreated(address _address, string _name)
```
